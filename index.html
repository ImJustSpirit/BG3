    <p>Hey, Jack here. Before we begin, I would like to thank everyone who has watched the sessions that have been going up on YouTube as well as those who have interacted on social media. With the final session releasing yesterday, I’m writing this post to share what I’ve learned doing this. Not only recording a Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) campaign, but also running a media campaign.</p>
    <p>First let’s give some background detail. ‘Baldur’s Gate: Rising of the Underdark (RotU)’ is set after ‘Baldur’s Gate: Descent into Avernus (DiA)’ but before ‘Baldur’s Gate III (BG3)’. The reason for this was that, as an assignment, we had to run a media campaign for an upcoming game. Being a big fan of D&D, I immediately jumped at the chance to do one for BG3. As almost anyone could guess, this was just a thinly veiled excuse to play D&D with friends. Recording ourselves playing is something we’ve attempted multiple times before but never got far with. So after rounding up a group of six players, which quickly turned to three, I then actually had to do everything else.</p>
    <p>Let’s start with the boring assignment stuff first. For this media campaign, I planned a detailed schedule which included: daily posts; posters; merchandise (the free kind); articles; and of course, the sessions. It wouldn’t take a genius to guess how I reacted when we came back from half-term break to be told we were starting that Friday. In all fairness, the start date was not only provided on the assignment itself, but also the schedule I’d spent hours doing work on. This sudden start caused me to basically forget everything I’d previously done and deal with it the same way I dealt with the D&D campaign itself, improv. Planned and scheduled daily posts? Nope, write them that day and post them. Weekly articles the day after the sessions go live? Not at all, the sessions didn’t even go out on the originally intended day anyway. As you can tell, it’s been chaotic.</p>
    <p>Now let’s start talking about what should be the fun stuff. I had around three week to plan RotU out in its entirety. I had some points I wanted to work with, such as the players being hired to escort the immigrants out of Baldur’s Gate as well as how the campaign would end. It stayed this way for a long time. Actually, it stayed this way until March 31st at which point I watched the D&D Movie (I very much enjoyed it) and was inspired by how that party travels into the Underdark. From that point I had four days to plan the campaign and prepare the necessary material. People who know me can probably see where this is going, but for those who don’t know me, I can have a very hard time focusing on stuff, especially when I don’t find it massively interesting. Now while I enjoy D&D and creating and whatnot, I have no interest in being crunched. This is pretty counterproductive as crunch is meant to get you to do the work while it just does the opposite for me. So over four days I get practically no prep done. Day of the campaign and I’m a bit panicked. I’m about to an all-day one shot and I’m not prepped in the slightest. I wanted the campaign to be six hours minimum, but I had blocked out nine without factoring in breaks. To fill this time I had the start and end of a story, some general plot points to hit, two decent maps and a couple of photo bashed monsters. It’s safe to say that I wasn’t nearly as prepped as I should be.</p>
    <p>Let’s go back to the night before, this time was largely spent sorting out the technical side. This was another thing I had been putting of for a long time as even if my resources weren’t so limited, it was a daunting task. During this time I tested long recording sessions as well as running everything necessary to make sure that my computer could handle it as well as to check how large the video files will be. Turns out video files are a lot smaller than I expected them to be. I was pretty happy with my makeshift setup at the time, but I really wish I had prepared more as I had some real issues with audio during the recording process and then again in editing. During the session, I changed the way I recorded it multiple times but the end result was alright. The only main issues was in the first twenty minutes of recording had echo due to me setting two microphones to record to the same output when they weren’t synced.</p>
    <p>The day of recording went well overall. I improvised when necessary, the campaign wrapped up just in time and I thought that we all had some good fun. I’m sure that, after reading all this, most people can guess how the rest went. I left everything to the last minute and rushed it. If people want to know what I’ve learned, the main thing was that I did not prepare enough. It’s small but it’s true. Below I’m sharing the maps I made for the campaign. All tokens were originally forgotten-adventures.net/ and maps were created on inkarnate.com/. The Underdark map was generated with http://dungeon-generator.fantasy-calendar.com/. Once again, thank you all for the support, it’s all greatly appreciated. Also, a quick reminder, Baldur’s Gate III fully releases on the thirty-first of August this year but is currently in early access right now. I wish you all the best in your future rolls.<br>- Jack<a href=""><button><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16px" height="16px" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-download" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M.5 9.9a.5.5 0 0 1 .5.5v2.5a1 1 0 0 0 1 1h12a1 1 0 0 0 1-1v-2.5a.5.5 0 0 1 1 0v2.5a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H2a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-2.5a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5z"/><path d="M7.646 11.854a.5.5 0 0 0 .708 0l3-3a.5.5 0 0 0-.708-.708L8.5 10.293V1.5a.5.5 0 0 0-1 0v8.793L5.354 8.146a.5.5 0 1 0-.708.708l3 3z"/></svg>Download the maps</button></a></p>
